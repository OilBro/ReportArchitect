The chart includes dual-line display comparing previous and current survey data, proper axis labeling with engineering units, and clear visual representation of settlement patterns. The chart quality is suitable for inclusion in regulatory submissions and client reports.

**Settlement Distribution (Polar View):** A sophisticated polar chart showing settlement distribution in a circular format that matches the physical geometry of tank foundations. The chart includes color-coded settlement zones, proper angular positioning markers (0°, 45°, 90°, etc.), and visual highlighting of maximum settlement areas. This visualization tool provides immediate visual assessment of settlement patterns that would be difficult to discern from tabular data alone.

#### API 653 Compliance
The settlement analysis system fully complies with API 653 Annex B requirements for foundation settlement evaluation. The system provides all necessary calculations and documentation required for regulatory compliance, including differential settlement calculations, settlement pattern analysis, and professional visualization tools.

The quality and completeness of the settlement analysis functionality demonstrates that the development team possesses the technical capabilities to create professional-grade inspection tools when properly implemented. This success provides a template for the level of quality that should be achieved in other calculation modules.

### PDF Export Functionality: Reliable Professional Output

The PDF export functionality continues to operate with **complete reliability** and produces professional-quality inspection reports suitable for regulatory submission and client delivery. This capability, combined with the restored data persistence functionality, enables complete inspection documentation workflows.

#### Export Process Reliability
PDF generation operates without errors and produces properly formatted documents with appropriate file naming conventions. The export process includes comprehensive data integration, ensuring that all entered inspection information is properly included in the generated reports. The system generates success confirmations and provides clear file identification for document management.

### Critical Deficiency: Shell Calculation Accuracy Failures

Despite the significant improvements in data persistence and continued excellence in settlement analysis, the shell calculation functionality remains **critically flawed** with dangerous accuracy errors that prevent the application from being suitable for safety-critical thickness analysis.

#### Calculation Error Analysis
Shell thickness calculations demonstrate systematic errors that produce results significantly different from correct API 653 calculations. Using test data with known correct results (40 ft fill height, 0.485" current thickness, Course 1), the application produces incorrect minimum required thickness calculations.

**Expected Results (Manual Verification):**
- Minimum Required Thickness: 0.650 inches
- Corrosion Rate: 1.5 mpy (based on 0.500" original, 0.485" current, 10 years)
- Safety Factor Compliance: Proper API 653 methodology

**Application Results:**
- Minimum Required Thickness: 0.100 inches (550% error)
- Corrosion Rate: 0.75 mpy (50% error)
- Safety Factor Application: Incorrect methodology

#### Safety Implications
The magnitude of these calculation errors creates **serious safety risks** if the application were used for actual API 653 inspections. The calculated minimum required thickness of 0.100 inches versus the correct value of 0.650 inches would result in approval of tank operation with dangerously inadequate wall thickness.

Such errors could lead to catastrophic tank failures, environmental releases, and serious safety incidents. The application cannot be considered suitable for professional use until these calculation errors are completely resolved and verified through comprehensive testing.

#### Technical Root Cause
The calculation errors appear to stem from incorrect implementation of API 653 calculation methodology, potentially including errors in stress calculation formulas, safety factor application, or unit conversion processes. The systematic nature of the errors suggests fundamental problems in the calculation engine rather than isolated coding mistakes.
