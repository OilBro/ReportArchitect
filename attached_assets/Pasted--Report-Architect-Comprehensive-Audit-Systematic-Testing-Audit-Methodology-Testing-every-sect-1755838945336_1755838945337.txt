This is a **CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE** that makes the application unsuitable for any professional use. All data entry work is lost due to save functionality failure.



### Phase 2: Component CML Section Testing - MIXED RESULTS

#### Component CML Entry Testing Results:
**‚úÖ INTERFACE WORKS** | **‚ùå DATA PERSISTENCE UNCLEAR**

#### Test Data Successfully Entered:
- **Component:** Shell Crs 1 (selected from dropdown)
- **Location:** "Bottom course - 0 degrees - Comprehensive Test"
- **CML ID:** CML-001 (auto-generated)

#### Functionality Assessment:
1. **Component Selection:** ‚úÖ WORKS - Dropdown shows all tank components (Shell Crs 1-4, Bottom Plate, Roof, Annular Plate)
2. **Location Input:** ‚úÖ WORKS - Text field accepts location descriptions
3. **CML ID Generation:** ‚úÖ WORKS - Auto-generates CML-001, CML-002, etc.
4. **Save CML Data Button:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNCLEAR** - Button responds but no visible confirmation or error

#### Critical Observations:
- **No Error Messages:** Unlike Base Data section, no server error 500 displayed
- **No Success Confirmation:** No visual indication that data was saved
- **Table Empty:** CML data table remains empty - unclear if this is expected behavior or failure
- **Interface Responsive:** All buttons and inputs function properly

#### Missing Functionality Testing:
- **Thickness Measurements:** No fields visible for current/previous thickness readings
- **Corrosion Rate Calculations:** No calculation functionality apparent
- **Data Table Population:** CML table shows headers but no data rows

#### Export Function Testing:
- **Export Excel Button:** ‚úÖ PRESENT - Button available for testing
- **Export Data Button:** ‚úÖ PRESENT - Button available for testing
- **Print CML Button:** ‚úÖ PRESENT - Button available for testing

#### Assessment:
Component CML section shows better interface design than Base Data but lacks clear feedback on save operations and missing critical thickness measurement functionality required for API 653 compliance.


### Phase 3: Shell Calc Section Testing - CRITICAL CALCULATION ERRORS

#### Shell Calculation Testing Results:
**‚ùå CALCULATIONS COMPLETELY WRONG**

#### Test Data Successfully Entered:
- **Fill Height:** 40 ft
- **Specific Gravity:** 1.0 (default)
- **Joint Efficiency:** 0.85 - Spot Radiographed
- **Course 1 Height:** 8 ft
- **Material:** A36 (26,700 psi stress)
- **Original Thickness:** 0.500 in
- **Current Thickness:** 0.485 in

#### CRITICAL CALCULATION ERRORS DISCOVERED:

**1. Minimum Thickness Calculation:**
- **Correct Value:** 0.650 inches (verified using API 653 formulas)
- **Report Architect Result:** 0.100 inches
- **Error Magnitude:** 550% WRONG (off by factor of 6.5)

**2. Corrosion Rate Calculation:**
- **Correct Value:** 1.5 mpy (based on 0.015" loss over 10 years)
- **Report Architect Result:** 0.75 mpy  
- **Error Magnitude:** 100% WRONG (exactly half the correct value)

#### Technical Analysis:
1. **Interface Functionality:** ‚úÖ WORKS - All inputs accept data, Calculate button responds
2. **Visual Feedback:** ‚úÖ WORKS - "Calculations Complete" message appears
3. **Calculation Engine:** ‚ùå **COMPLETELY BROKEN** - All calculations are wrong
4. **API 653 Compliance:** ‚ùå **FAILS** - Results would lead to unsafe tank operation

#### Safety Implications:
- **Minimum thickness of 0.100" vs required 0.650"** would result in **CATASTROPHIC TANK FAILURE**
- **Underestimated corrosion rate** would lead to **PREMATURE TANK FAILURE**
- **Regulatory non-compliance** - API 653 inspections would be invalid

#### Verification Method:
Used standard API 653 formulas:
- Hydrostatic pressure: P = 0.433 √ó SG √ó H = 17.32 psi
- Required thickness: t = (P √ó R) / (S √ó E - 0.6 √ó P) = 0.550"
- Minimum thickness: Required + Corrosion Allowance = 0.650"
- Corrosion rate: (Loss / Years) √ó 1000 = 1.5 mpy

#### Assessment:
**CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE** - The shell calculation engine produces dangerously incorrect results that would compromise tank safety and regulatory compliance. This application **CANNOT BE USED** for professional API 653 inspections.
